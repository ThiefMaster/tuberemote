# TubeRemote

TubeRemote is a Firefox extension that allows a local WebSocket server to
remote-control playback in the currently-active YouTube tab. It's meant to
be used with [my rotaryboard controller app][controller].

It's kept pretty simple since it doesn't need to do anything beyond what
it does right now. 🐒
